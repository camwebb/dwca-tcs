# Taxon Concept Schema extension for the Darwin Core Archive

The TDWG Taxon Concept Transfer Schema (TCS;
[github repo](https://github.com/tdwg/tcs)) is still the primary
vehicle for transferring information about details of taxon concepts
(which are taxonName plus accordingTo constructs), the relationships
among them. With the dominance of the GBIF-maintained Darwin Core
Archive (DwCA), it would be valuable to be able to express the same
inter-taxon-concept relationships in a DwCA.

This repo contains files for defining a DwCA extension for the
`TaxonRelationshipAssertion` element of TCS. Note than this element is
just part of the full TCS schame.
